	From @sreschke80 (thanks!):
	- Add NULL check for parameter writestatus in zs_entryend()
	- Remove (redundant) NULL check for parameter name in zs_entrybegin()

2023.5.14:
	- Cleanups for unused variable and parameter warnings.

2019.11.14: 2.3
	- Fix encoding of entry modification times on non-Windows, thanks @sreschke80.

2019.4.27: 2.2
	- Add support for Windows including Makefile.nmake for building.
	Installation of zlib on Windows remains as an exercise for the caller.
	Testing was performed with the pre-compiled binaries from:
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/uqm-mods/files/latest/download
	- By @kugel-: fix some potential minor leaks in error handling.

2017.1.17: 2.1
	- By @kugel-: fix leaks and warnings.  Thanks!
	- By @sreschke80: free allocated resources on failure.  Thanks!

2015.10.4: 2.0
	Reorganize fdzipstream.c with suggestions from @Crog.
	- Support for arbitrary methods through call back functions and convert
	the included STORE and DEFLATE methods to use this interface.
	- Remove duplication, zs_writeentry() is now a simple wrapper around
	other functions.  All ZIP archives will now be created with streaming
	structures as the capability to create them without is removed.
	- Remove zs_entryflush() external interface, flushing is now a part of
	zs_entryend().
	- Changes to zipfiles.c example: remove streaming versus not code and
	explicity entry flushing to match changes in API.

2015.8.2: 1.1
	- Rework deflate() logic for flexibility and simplicity.
	- Add zs_entryflush() as a simple wrapper to flush internal compression
	buffers without new data.  Thanks to @Crog for reporting and suggesting.
	- Update zipfiles.c example code to use new zs_entryflush().
	- Allow retry of write() in zs_writedata() for incomplete writes as
	suggested by @Crog.
	- Add Apache 2 licensing notices.

2013.9.28: 1.0
	- Initial version.  Supports classic ZIP archive creation, files/entries
	with streaming structures (data can be chunked) and ZIP64 Central
	Directory structures for archives totalling more then 4GB in size.
